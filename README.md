# Countdown-Letters-Game-Solver
Finds all the possible english words that can be made in the Countdown Letters game

# What is the Countdown Letters game?
Countdown is a popular TV game show in the UK and there are two types of games in it - the numbers game and the letters game. In the letters game the two contestants get 9 random letters and they each have to try to generate the longest word in the English language out of those letters.
So I made a python program that takes those 9 letters and looks through a massive list of about 300000 words and prints all the possible words that can be made, sorting them into a list corresponding to the length of the word found.

# Files:
[cdwords.py](cdwords.py) - program which prints all the possible words that can be made from the letters. The letters themselves can be typed in the 'characters' variable

[cdwords.txt](cdwords.txt) - List of all the words 9 letters or shorter in the English language. The words were taken from the words_alpha.txt file [here](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words).
